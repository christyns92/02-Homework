# 02-Refactoring
## Purpose of Assignment:

The purpose of this assignment was to check for errors in the code, as well as, eliminate redundancy throughout the css stylesheet. This simplifies the coding and makes it look more clean to the visual eye.

## How To Use:
The website itself is very user-friendly and easy to navigate. You can click on any one of the categories on the nav bar and it automatically scrolls you down to where that information is on the page.

## Changes:
1. Fixing broken link in html on line 29 by adding in the ID. Now you can successfully click on the link and it takes you to that section of the website

2. In the right hand section of the website(Lead Generation, Brand Awareness and Cost Management), I set all images to the same class since they all have the same CSS characteristics to eliminiate redundancy in the stylesheet. (Class was set to "benefits-div")
4. Assigned the class "horiseon" to lines 29, 36, and 43 to group them together and reduce repetition in the CSS sheet. 
5. Applied alt tags to images to make the website more accessible.
